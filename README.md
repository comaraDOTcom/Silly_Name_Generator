# silly_name_generator

This code is for building a silly_name_generator, based on the TV show "Psych" in which detective Spencer Sleuth introduces his sidekick, Gus with names made up on the fly. Names like Galileo Humpkins, Lavender Gooms, and Bad News Marvin Barnes.

Here I try to build a silly name generator to compete with the nutty nicknames concocted by Spencer's imagination!

Things I learnt doing this project were:  
	1. pylint  
	2. pydocstyle  
	3. if __name__ == "__main":  
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	main()
